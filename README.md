Hello,
this is a public repository for scripts that I found useful and may or may not use them on occassion.
Those scripts I wrote some time age (or recently) and were cleaned up and simplified using AI and their main goal was to either "dumb down" somethings or simplify thigs that I was doing using more basic scripts (powershell/bash).
Feel free to grab them, edit them, do whatever you want with them.
