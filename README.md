Hello,
this is a public repository for scripts that I found useful and may or may not use them on occassion.
Those scripts were made using AI and their main goal was to either "dumb down" somethings or simplify thigs that I was doing using more basic scripts (powershell/bash).
Feel free to grab them, edit them, do whatever you want with them.
