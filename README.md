Hello,
this is a public repository for scripts that I found useful and may or may not use them on occassion.
Those scripts I wrote some time age (or recently) and were cleaned up and simplified using AI and their main goal was to either "dumb down" somethings or simplify thigs that I was doing using more basic scripts (powershell/bash).
Feel free to grab them, edit them, do whatever you want with them.


Scripts:
- ow_summary.sh - script that generate simple summary on a Linux machine when user logs in
- logon_time.ps1 - script that opens an GUI to help parse login times from Windows Event Viewer
- modify_VM.ps1 - script that helps to modify virtual machine settings that are deployed on VMware vCenter
- xcopy_gui.ps1 - script that open an GUI in order to copy files through the network from one machine to multiple destination in the same network
